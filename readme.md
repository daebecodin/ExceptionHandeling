# Java Exception Handling Demos

This project contains a series of Java programs designed to demonstrate key concepts of exception handling in Java. Each file focuses on a different aspect, including try-catch blocks, multiple catch blocks, throwing exceptions, inheritance, and more.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Exception Demo Files
- `ExceptionDemo1.java`: Basic use of `try` and `catch` for runtime errors.
- `ExceptionDemo2.java`: Multiple catch blocks and how Java selects the appropriate one.
- `ExceptionDemo3.java`: Using `finally` to run cleanup code regardless of exception status.
- `ExceptionDemo4.java`: Custom exception throwing with `throw` and `throws`.
- `ExceptionDemo5.java`: Handling user input with exception checking.
- `ExceptionDemo6.java`: Nested try-catch blocks and control flow.
- `ExceptionDemo7.java`: Demonstrates re-throwing exceptions and custom error messages.

### Supporting File
- `SuperClassOfException.java`: A custom superclass used to demonstrate user-defined exceptions and inheritance.
